# WeatherChangeObserver

I want to design a website that will automatically or manually upload the weather conditions of a specific area, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. Then compare it for a month or more to calculate the weather change

Name: WeatherChangeObserver
DbSet<weather> DbSet<humidity> Dbset<windSpeed>
