# WeatherChangeObserver

I want to design a website that will automatically or manually upload the weather conditions of a specific area, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. Then compare it for a month or more to calculate the weather change

Name: WeatherChangeObserver
DbSet<weather> DbSet<humidity> Dbset<windSpeed>

  //Maybe because I didn't go to the first class, I have no clue about this webaqq project. I just imagined a Web application proposal according to the introduction. If it doesn't meet the requirements, I will reconsider it.
